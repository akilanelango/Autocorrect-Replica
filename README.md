# Autocorrect-Replica
This C program demonstrates an autocorrect functionality using a hash table and the Levenshtein distance algorithm. It reads a CSV file containing a dictionary of words, builds a hash table with the words, and then autocorrects user-inputted sentences by suggesting corrections for misspelled words based on the Levenshtein distance.
